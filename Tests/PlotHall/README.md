### Description 
In this test the ATtiny85 is connected to a hall sensor as well as an RS485 module. The sensor will read the hall sensor and stream the values to an ATmega328 with a RS485 module and a OLED screen. The ATmega328 will plot the values on the display. Ideally this can be used to visualize the hall sensor data and set appropriate limits.
